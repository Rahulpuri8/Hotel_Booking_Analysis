Hotel Booking Analysis
Overview
This repository contains an analysis of hotel booking data aimed at identifying the factors contributing to high cancellation rates. The analysis focuses on various aspects of the booking process, with particular attention to the average daily rate of hotels and other potential influencers.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Dataset Source Name]. It comprises hotel booking information including features such as booking date, lead time, average daily rate, and whether a booking was canceled or not.

Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Categorical variables were encoded appropriately, and numerical features were scaled as required.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed to understand the distribution of key features. Initial insights were gained into the relationship between cancellation rates and various factors including arrival date, lead time, and average daily rate.

Average Daily Rate Analysis: The average daily rate of hotels was considered a crucial factor affecting cancellations. A detailed analysis was conducted to compare the average daily rates of canceled bookings versus completed bookings. This analysis included visualizations such as box plots and histograms.

Lead Time Investigation: Another aspect explored was the lead time between booking and arrival. The hypothesis that longer lead times might correlate with higher cancellation rates was tested. This involved grouping data based on lead time intervals and calculating cancellation percentages for each group.

Booking Channels and Market Segments: The source of bookings (online travel agencies, direct, corporate) and the market segment (leisure, corporate, groups, etc.) were considered potential factors affecting cancellations. Their impact on cancellation rates was studied through cross-tabulations and visualization.

Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix was computed to quantify the relationships between different numerical variables, aiming to identify any strong correlations that might explain cancellations.

Findings
After conducting the analysis, the following key findings were observed:

Bookings with significantly high or low average daily rates had higher cancellation rates. There seemed to be a 'sweet spot' for rates that led to more confirmed bookings.

Bookings with excessively long lead times displayed higher cancellation rates. This might suggest a need for flexible cancellation policies for such bookings.

Bookings made through certain online travel agencies exhibited higher cancellation rates compared to direct bookings or bookings made through other channels.

The market segment had varying effects on cancellation rates, with some segments showing notably higher or lower rates of cancellations.

Correlation analysis indicated a moderate positive correlation between lead time and cancellation rate.

Conclusion
The analysis highlights several factors contributing to high hotel booking cancellation rates. The average daily rate, lead time, booking source, and market segment all play a role in influencing cancellation behavior. To mitigate cancellations, hotels could consider optimizing their pricing strategies within the 'sweet spot' of average daily rates, offering flexible policies for bookings with longer lead times, and potentially evaluating partnerships with online travel agencies to improve the quality of bookings.
